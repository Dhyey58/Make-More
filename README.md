# MAKE MORE (Neural Network Experiments)

This repository contains implementations and experiments in neural networks, inspired by **Andrej Karpathy's** deep learning tutorials. The project includes multiple Jupyter Notebooks that explore key concepts such as **backpropagation, activation functions, batch normalization, and deep learning architectures** like MLPs and WaveNet.

## 📌 Project Overview
The repository consists of various parts covering different aspects of deep learning, from fundamental concepts to building advanced architectures. The main focus is to understand **gradient-based optimization, activations, and sequence modeling** through hands-on implementation.
